# D-CCA
This python package implements the D-CCA method proposed in [1]. See [example.py](https://github.com/shu-hai/D-CCA/blob/master/example.py) for details, with Python 3.5 or above.

```
D-CCA conducts the following decomposition:

Y_k =  X_k + E_k = C_k + D_k + E_k   for   k=1,2

where C_1 and C_2 share the same latent factors, but D_1 and D_2 have uncorrelated latent factors.
```
